1) Right-click the `SetupLlama3WebAppForWindows11.bat` file and click Run as administrator.
2) At this point, the `SetupLlama3WebAppForWindows11.bat` starts to automatically download, install, and run Docker Desktop, Ollama, Llama3, and Open-WebUI, and launch Open-WebUI or Llama3 Web App for you to register off-line local user and use Llama3 in your local web browser.
3) When Docker Desktop Survey window pops up, just select your desired choices and select Next or Continue to finish setting up Docker Desktop.

6) Wait for 15-20 seconds for Llama3:latest-8b to fully load. Then, type hello or hi and press Enter key to verify whether Llama3 is ready to accept and answer your questions.
   If Llama3 responds to your hello or hi, then you can continue to ask Llama3 any questions. If it does not answer you, wait for 30 seconds and try again.
